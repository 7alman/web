"<p>When Sir Tim Berners-Lee first invented the World Wide Web in the late 1980s&nbsp;to make information sharing on the Internet easier, he did something very important. He specified an open protocol, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP, that anyone could use to make information available and to access such information. &nbsp;</p>\n"
"<p>Gitcoin is similarly built on an open protocol of smart contracts.</p>\n"
