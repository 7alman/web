                                    Hey there, welcome to the 'new bouny' creation flow

                                    <br>    
                                    <br>    
                                    Are you ready to post funded work?  We've seen over 300 funded issues on the Gitcoin platform; Here are some best practices:
                                    <br>    
                                    <br>    

                                    <ul>    
                                        <li>
                                            <strong>Know what you're looking for</strong> - Are you looking to find a future collaborator, or just to get something done quickly?  Have you outlined clear acceptance criteria for your issue?  What is an acceptance time frame for your work?
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <strong>Pick a fair price</strong> - The best rule of thumb for picking a price is to multiply (1) the number of hours it'd take a senior engineer to complete the scope * (2) the complexity of the task * (3) the hourly rate of a senior engineer.  If you underfund the issue, it might not get picked up quickly (if at all).
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <strong>Documentation is key</strong> - If it's easy for a collaborator to get up &amp; running with your codebase; you're more likely to have success with a bounty.  Does your repo enforce strong code standards and patterns, please make sure those are well-communicated!
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <strong>Leave room for error</strong> - Especially if your task is iterative or has a qualitative acceptance criteria, it's a good practice to leave some budget for <a href=/tips>a tip</a> at the end of the project.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <strong>Beware the project management triangle</strong> - Do you want work that's (1) Good, (2) Cheap, of (3) Fast?  Pick 2 of the 3, and design your bounty around those constraints! 
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
